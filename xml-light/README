let x = Xml.parse_string "<a href='url'>TEXT<begin/><end/></a>" in
Printf.printf "XML formated = \n%s" (Xml.to_string_fmt x);

-- load an xml and a dtd , prove and print ---

let x = Xml.parse_file "myfile.xml" in
let dtd = Dtd.parse_file "myfile.dtd" in
let x = Dtd.prove (Dtd.check dtd) "start" x in
print_endline (Xml.to_string x)
